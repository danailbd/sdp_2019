Today we'll make another part of our application - we'll add create a queue of songs for playing. We'd want to sequentially play a list of songs. We don't know how many song a user would want to listen to, so we should support any size of such list.

For that purpose we will need:
- work on our pre-existing implementation;
- think about how we want it to look (what interface)
- sketch an initial idea - write it incrementally
- test our solution
- improve solution
- play each song
- what about playing previous song?


### Concepts
- Single responsibility
- DRY
